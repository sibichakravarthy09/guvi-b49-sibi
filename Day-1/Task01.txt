DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP1.1 AND HTTP2 

 
1. HTTP1.1: Hypertext Transfer protocol, is a protocol using which hypertext is transferred over the web
         its a simplicity has been the most widely used protocol for data transfer throw the web.
         Anyone between the browser and server can read it relatively easily if one intercepts this
         exchange of data.
         { 1. Its a synonym to ‘accessing internet’ for most of us. Came into being in 1991.}
         { 2. HTTP protocol was developed in 1989 as the common language that enables client and server machines’.}
         { 3. The client (browser) has to send a request to the server using the method (GET/POST).}
         { 4. HTTP1.1 is the textual framing layer.}
         { 5. It compresses data by itself..}
         

2. HTTPS2.0
          { 1.In 2015, a new version of http called http2 was created.} 
          { 2.HTTP/2 can continue functioning as normal when interacting with the new protocol..}
          { 3.HTTP/2 is the binary framing layer,.} 
          { 4.HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficent than HTTP/1.1.}
          { 5.HTTP/2 it use HPACK for data compression.}

objects and  its internal representation :
   
                                                     objects

  Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
  These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol)
  in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
  Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
  An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
  That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
  Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, 
  in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively,  
  in the context of an object.
